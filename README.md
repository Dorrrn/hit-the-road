# About
This is my first game, created after 2 weeks of learning coding during ironhack bootcamp.

# How to play
Once you opened the game, it will start automatically.
Your goal is to collect green goodies, which will increase your score and level up at certain points.
You have to avoid red obstacles, otherwise your game is over...

Have fun :)
